\date{\today}%\\\textbf{RE: Graduate Hardware Engineer - Implementation (CPU) (5207) }}

\opening{Dear Recruiting Committee,}
\closing{With kindest regards,}


\makelettertitle
\vspace{-5mm}
I would like to express my interest in the Junior IC Design Engineer position at Broadcom.\\
I have just completed my master degree in Electronic Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Turin (Italy) with final grade: 110/110 (GPA: 3.71). 
As formal specialization of my last two academical years I choose \textit{Electronics Systems}, this allowed me to have a broad electronic knowledge, focusing on digital electronics. \\  
I believe that my skills, my passion for SoC design, and interest in digital communications  make me an ideal candidate for this position.\\
As a candidate, here is what I could immediately bring to the table:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with other staff, and have good interpersonal skills}: strongly improved during my 6-month experience at \textit{Harvard-MIT Health Science and Technology}, where I carried out my master thesis.
\item Experience of development in C/C++, primarily  used for embedded processors in both personal and professional projects.
\item Knowledge in SoC and ASIC design: acquired during my master degree with some experience in every level of the design workflow (refers to CV for more details and links to Github repository).
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-1mm}

I also have basic knowledge of UNIX shell, Java, SystemC, Verilog, Python and UML. \\
As a meticulous person, I work hard and pay much attention to details, always aiming to improve myself. I am a quick learner and highly motivated worker.
Finally, I am able to work in a team as well as by myself.\\
For any other information, please contact me through the addresses provided in CV.\\
Thank you for your time and for considering my application, I hope to hear from you in the future.\\

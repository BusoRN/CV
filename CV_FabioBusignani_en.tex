%My interest for electronics goes beyond the academic studies: in fact, I spend a good part of my free time experimenting and prototyping with microcontrollers and embedded systems boards.

%\section{About Me}
%\cvline{}{Fabio is a new graduate in Electronic Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Turin.  While he achieved high marks in school, his interest for electronics goes
%	well beyond the academic setting. Indeed in his free time, he loves to experiment and prototype
%	with microcontrollers and embedded systems boards as well as deepen some interesting topic. \newline
%	After he took a bachelor degree in Electronics, Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Bologna he choose to moved to Turin enrolling at the formal specialization in Electronic Systems, because it allowed him to have a sound electronic knowledge, focusing on digital electronics where he made some experience in every level of the design workflow of digital hardware implementation and SoC design. To carry out his Master Thesis, Fabio joined Khademhosseini Lab, a research group of Harvard-MIT Health Science and Technology. During this 6-month experience  he became
%	immediately involved in a project on customizing Google Glass for its application in
%	biomedicine. To fulfill this aim he designed from the scratch a completely new system 
%	based on the BeagleBone Black. This highly integrated platform can seamlessly collect data from all the biosensors including the pH, temperature, and the microscope, which are then directly
%	transmitted to the Google App Engine and finally downloaded and showed on Google Glass. More interestingly,
%	Fabio also added the capability to control the experiments using the Google Glass.  In another project, he designed a miniature function generator  used to stimulate the cardiomyocytes cultured on three-dimensional scaffolds to enhance the alignment and maturation of the cells for engineering better functional cardiac tissues. \newline
%	Now Fabio is working on Sherlock project, where he collaborates with the team as hardware and firmware designer. }

%%Qui di seguito verranno elencati i progetti da me svolti durante gli studi per il corretto conseguimento di alcuni corsi.  \\
\cventry{2013-2014}{Integrated System Architecture}{Polytechnic University of Turin}{Torino}{Italy}{Design of a FIR filter adopting pipeline technique to achieve the given clock frequency. The softwares exploited are \textit{Modelsim} and \textit{Synopsys}.\newline Design of an architecture which implements DCT, using \textit{TTA} architecture. The software used is \textit{TCE}, exploited for statistic approach in order to optimize the algorithm. \newline Design of an \textit{ACS} (Add-Compare-Select) unit. The architecture was described in SystemC. \textit{Modelsim}, \textit{G++} compiler and \textit{GTKWave} have been exploited to simulate the architecture.\newline \href{https://github.com/BusoRN/ISA-projects}{Github link.}}
\cventry{2013-2014}{Operating Systems}{Polytechnic University of Turin}{Turin}{Italy}{Designed a Multithreaded version of Blowfish Algorithm.\newline

\cventry{2012-2013}{Digital Integrated Systems}{Polytechnic University of Turin}{Torino}{Italy}{Design of an interface which manages the communications in a master-multi slave system. For this project a typical standard protocol of System-on-Chip communications, \textit{Whisbone},was exploited. The EDA softwares used are Modelsim and Quarts.
\newline 
Design of a processing element which implements a \textit{Butterfly}. In this project several hardware constraints were given, and they were solved through the adoption of the \textit{folding} technique.  }
\cventry{2012-2013}{Low Power Electronic Systems}{Polytechnic University of Turin}{Torino}{Italy}{ %Laboratory experiences:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item 	\textit{Power Estimation: probabilistic techniques}, used Modelsim to perform a power analysis of some combinatorial circuit described in VHDL.
%		\item  \textit{FSM State Assignment and VHDL Synthesis} using Synopsys.
%		\item  \textit{Clock gating, pipelining and parallelizing}, using Synopsys to synthesis and Modelsim for simulation. 
%		\item \textit{Bus encoding}, performed power analysis of a data transmission with different encoding methods: bus invert, transition-based, gray, T0.
%		\item \textit{Leakage}: using spice for characterizing cells
%		and pen\&paper for memory organization.
%	\end{enumerate}
	Final Project:\newline
	Design of a serial interface that allows the interaction between a control unit and a computing unit. The interface must be specifically embedded inside a system which controls the supply noise inside integrated circuits. The aim was to realize a very low power interface, and in order to do this,  certain low power design methods were exploited, such as clock gating and state encoding. Synthesis was made with \textit{Synopsys}. \newline \href{https://github.com/BusoRN/Low-Power-Project}{Github link.}}
